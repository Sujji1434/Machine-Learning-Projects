                     **SmartBuild Case Study: Proactive Error Prediction**
                     
_PROBLEM STATEMENT_
1. Can we predict the error types with high accuracy, leveraging input raw material properties and machine settings, before the machine is even used?
   
**Programming language**:Python

**Goal**: Improve product quality, reduce costly defects.

**Machine Learning Methodology**
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Selection
3. Evaluation Metrics

_For predictive analysis, we strategically selected two robust ensemble models – XGBoost and Random Forest Classifier – 
known for their strong performance and ability to handle complex, tabular data like SmartBuild's production logs._

**Random Forest Classifier**: A Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble machine learning model that combines the predictions of many individual decision trees, 
each trained on random subsets of data, to achieve a highly accurate and robust final prediction through majority voting.

**XGBoost Classifier**: An XGBoost Classifier (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and highly efficient machine learning model that sequentially builds a series of decision trees, 
with each new tree correcting the errors of the previous ones, ultimately combining their predictions to achieve extremely high accuracy and performance.

                                                         **Conclusion and Insights**
Our advanced machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest Classifier, have proven capable of accurately forecasting product defects based solely on raw material input properties and machine settings.

**Avoid Costly Rejects**: Prevent the production of faulty items, saving the full 150 EUR per product by discarding raw material at a mere 10 EUR loss,
thus turning a potential significant financial hit into a minimal one.

**Enhance Product Quality**

**Optimize Production Processe**s: Gain actionable insights from feature importance, allowing engineers to identify and adjust the most influential parameters like FluxCompensation and 
rotation_speed to mitigate risks proactively.
